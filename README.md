# SOLID-Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming and software design that aim to make software more maintainable, flexible, and easier to understand. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are often considered fundamental guidelines for writing clean and maintainable code. The SOLID acronym stands for:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**
   - A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.
   - This principle encourages you to design classes that have a single, well-defined purpose and avoid creating classes that do too much.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**
   - Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - Instead of modifying existing code, you should be able to extend its behavior by adding new code.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**
   - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
   - In other words, objects of derived classes should be able to replace objects of their base classes without affecting the correctness of the program.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**
   - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
   - This principle advises against creating large, monolithic interfaces but rather designing smaller, specific interfaces that cater to the needs of the clients that use them.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
   - Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
   - This principle promotes the use of dependency injection and encourages decoupling between high-level and low-level modules.

These principles provide guidelines for designing classes and systems that are more modular, maintainable, and extensible. They help developers create code that is easier to test, understand, and modify over time. Applying SOLID principles can lead to cleaner, more flexible code and is often considered a best practice in software development.
